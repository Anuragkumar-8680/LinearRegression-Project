# Linear Regression Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a simple linear regression model. The project is intended to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of linear regression in machine learning.

## About the Project

The `LinearRegression.ipynb` notebook covers the following key steps:
- **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset for the model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training the linear regression model.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using relevant metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the results to visualize the model's fit.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Anuragkumar-8680/LinearRegression.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```
    cd LinearRegression
    ```
3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the `LinearRegression.ipynb` file.
